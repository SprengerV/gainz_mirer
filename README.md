## Testing

Clone the repository. Create a file named ".env" that contains the text "MONGODB_URI=<your connection uri>" with "<your connection uri>" replaced by the connection URI to your mongoDB database. Run the command "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies. Optionally, you can run "npm run seed" to seed the database with workouts for testing purposes.
